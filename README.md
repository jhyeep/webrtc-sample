## WebRTC Test App (Chrome)
The app was made by modifying the source code from https://github.com/Swizec/webrtc-sample. It uses the same signaling server. The code was also modified to allow each peer to send up to 5 streams of the same video (for experimental purposes through chrome://webrtc-internals).
